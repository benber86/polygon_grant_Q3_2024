## Section 3: Project/Idea exploration

### Please clearly state what the project is about, what problems it is trying to solve, why the project thinks those problems are important and why you or your team are the one to solve those problems. *

We are developing a readable, efficient and secure programming language for smart contracts.

Problems We're Solving:

1. Security Vulnerabilities: Other smart contract languages often introduce security risks through features like inline assembly and class inheritance. Vyper eliminates these pitfalls, and instead focuses on making contracts simple to read and therefore easier and cheaper to audit. The team is also working on implementing better out-of-the-box testing and fuzzing features as well as state of the art compiler verification methods, ensuring comprehensive and robuts security across all aspects of development. 

2. Contract Bloat: Other compilers often produce contracts with bloated bytecode and gas costs that are higher than they should be. Thanks to a highly optimized backend, Vyper already consistently produces binaries 50% smaller than Solidity, with significantly lower gas consumption (https://blog.chain.link/solidity-vs-vyper/, https://github.com/z80dev/gascomps, https://github.com/benber86/vyper_bytecode) and we will continue to improve this headstart.

3. Language Diversity: Most EVM smart contracts are written in Solidity which is a strong centralization vector and security risk. Vyper is currently the only real alternative 

4. Developer Onboarding: Vyper's pythonic syntax makes it easy to onboard new developers to web3, as Python is now the most popular programming language (Stack Overflow survey 2024, https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/). A recent Twitter poll with 164 participants showed that a majority of developers would pick Vyper and Ape over Solidity and Foundry to start a new project (https://x.com/0xKoga/status/1805524364948893756).

### Are you already deployed on Polygon and if so, what date did you deploy?*

Vyper contracts have been deployed to Polygon since at least 2021.

### How does your project implement the Polygon blockchain and which parts will be on-chain?*

Vyper supports Polygon and all EVM chains. Vyper contracts are used by protocols such as Curve and Yearn on Polygon.

### Describe your team composition, relevant competencies and previous achievements*

The Vyper team is composed of highly experienced web3 engineers with expertise in compilers and security, with an extensive understanding of the EVM, smart contract development, and the associated security considerations. They have collaborated extensively with auditors and security researchers, contributed to the growth of the Ethereum ecosystems via EIPs, and their expertise is widely recognized within the EVM developers and security communities. The project also has over 20 regular contributors. The team currently consists of:

- Charles (https://github.com/charles-cooper, https://x.com/big_tech_sux). Charles is the lead developer of Vyper and Titanoboa (https://github.com/vyperlang/titanoboa). Charles also contributes to multiple Ethereum tooling projects (py-evm, pyrevm, eth-abi) and is the author of several EIPs.
- Harry (https://github.com/harkal, https://x.com/harkal). Harry has been working on Vyper's intermediate representation (Venom) since 2023. Harry has over 10 years of experience in embedded programming and computer graphics.
- cyberthirst (https://github.com/cyberthirst). Cyberthirst is a Vyper contributor who has worked on compiler security since 2023 and has an academic background in compiler verification research.
- Adam (https://github.com/hodanplodky). Adam is a web3 engineer working on Vyper's intermediate representation.

### Indicate your current traction (MAU, DAU, retention, TVL or other relevant metrics) if your product is already live on Polygon or on a different chain*

Vyper is used by Curve ($18m TVL on Polygon: https://defillama.com/protocol/curve-finance#tvl-charts) and Yearn ($11m TVL on Polygon: https://defillama.com/protocol/yearn-finance#tvl-charts)

### Who are your competitors? Are there any similar existing solutions on Polygon? If yes, mention similar solutions and elaborate on your product's advantages.*

Vyper's main competitors are other smart contract programming language such as Solidity, Fe and Yul. Vyper differs by its focus on readability, security and simplicity. Vyper is designed to make contract maximally human readable. This translates in a direct reduction (-20% according to auditors) of the time and costs of auditing Vyper contracts. Simplicity translates to more optimized contracts, which have, on average 50% smaller bytecode and less gas costs. Vyper's simple, pythonic syntax and the absence of footguns (operator and function overloading, class inheritance, etc.) makes it easy to onboard new developers already familiar with Python.

## Section 4: Grant details

### What is the size of your grant request? (Enter specific numeric POL Amount)*

Grantees are free to submit their proposal with any grant amount they desire to secure; however, all grants above 50K POL will invite special scrutiny & diligence and will take a longer time frame to evaluate. (Enter numeric POL amount)

Below are some example ranges you should be considering. Please note the specific amount you are requesting for your project.

- 5,000-10,000 MATIC
- 10,000-30,000 MATIC
- 30,000-50,000 MATIC
- 50,000+ MATIC
